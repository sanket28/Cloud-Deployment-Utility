# Cloud Deployment Utility

## Management Server VM  
- This method works on Mac OS X and you will need to have VMWare Fusion for this to work  
- Create a new folder on your system and name it "Management Server"  
- Download all the management server VM files from https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B4XlJVKJCun7b2dsTGMtM204dTg&usp=sharing
- Copy all of the downloaded files to the newly created "Management Server" folder  
- Rename the folder to "Management Server.vmwarevm". __It will ask you if you want to add the extension .vmwarevm to the folder. Select "Yes"__
- Double click the __Management Server.vmwarevm__ file
- VMware Fusion will ask if you have moved the virtual machine or copied it. Select that you __Moved It__ and the VM should power on
- At the login prompt enter __cloudmanager__ as the username and __cs8674-cloudmanager__ as the password
